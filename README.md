Welcome to my Phase-1 project!

INTRODUCTION 

This app is a single-page, responsive website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It allows user to quickly add and display products on the webpage.With this app users can effortlessly manage their inventory, helps them keep track of their products and make updates. The app creates a card for each product and its price. 'Add' and 'Clear' buttons simply allow user to create a space for new product and hides them all once 'Clear' button clicked.

'Online Marketplace' app is a good start for the ones who want to build their own E-commerce website.'Add to Cart' button is not activated but  added in JavaScript as a demonstration, for users to easily click and add the items they would like to buy!

Here is the URL of the API 'https://dummyjson.com/products' which includes 30 different products, brand names, and images. These are also accessible in db.json file.

#To install JSON Server :

#To start the server :
